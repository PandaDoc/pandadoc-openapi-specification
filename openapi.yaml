    PandaDoc API spans a broad range of functionality to help you build incredible documents automation experiences inside your product.

    PandaDoc API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

    ## Getting started

    You can start testing PandaDoc API with a sandbox key on our [Enterprise](https://www.pandadoc.com/pricing/) plan, either active or in trial.

    Generate your [sandbox key](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/sandbox-key) on the Developer Dashboard with predefined [rate limits](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/limits). Or contact our solutions expert if you work with high-transaction volumes.

    ## Guides

    If you’re just getting started with PandaDoc, you may want to jump straight into one of our [getting started guides](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/getting-started) for the feature you’re most interested in, whether that’s:

    - [Create from template](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/create-send-document),
    - [Upload and send a local PDF](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/upload-and-send-a-local-pdf),
    - or [Listening for changes in document status](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/listen-document-status-changes).

    We also recommend you to discover our dynamic content generation on a fly: [Create from a template with content placeholder](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/create-with-content-placeholders-from-template).

      summary: Create/Refresh Access Token
      operationId: accessToken
      security: []
      description: |
        Create or refresh an access token to make requests on behalf of a user. This endpoint is used to obtain an `access_token` and `refresh_token` for the first time, and to refresh the `access_token` when it expires.
        This endpoint is part of OAuth 2.0 implementation. You need to configure OAuth App to obtain `client_id` and `client_secret`. Read more about [OAuth 2.0 implementation](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/authentication-process).
        Make sure you're sending the header `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. 

        ## Create Access Token
        As a result of the OAuth 2.0 user authentication process, you should get a `code` that can be exchanged for an `access_token`. Use this endpoint to do this exchange, and to refresh the token later.

        > 🚧 Invalid Grant?
        > 
        > If you receive an `invalid grant` response it is likely because you used the same `code` more than once from the [Authorize a PandaDoc User](ref:authorize-a-user) step above. The `code` parameter is generated for one-time use. A new `code` value must be generated if you wish to change API users, permissions, or simply generate a new `code` value for the same PandaDoc user.

        > 📘 expires_in
        > 
        > `expires_in` is based in seconds. Currently, a token expires in 31535999 seconds = 1 year.

        ## Refresh Access Token
        Eventually, `access_token` expires and accessing an API method returns **401 unauthorized**. Your application needs to refresh the OAuth2 token with the stored `refresh_token` returned when initially creating an access token.

        Once refreshed, calls on behalf of the originally authorized user can resume immediately. Use the newly returned `access_token` for all future API requests.

        > 🚧 Invalid Grant?
        > 
        > If you receive an `invalid grant` response, it is likely because your `refresh_token` is invalid.

        It is useful to request document status to ensure a document is in the expected state before calling additional API methods. 

        ### Required Document Statuses

        Here are some common methods and the `document.status` required to proceed:

        | API Method           | Required Document State |
        | :------------------- | :---------------------- |
        | Send A Document      | `document.draft`        |
        | Get Document Details | `document.draft`        |
        | Embed A Document     | `document.sent`         |
        | Download A Document  | `document.completed`    |

        > 📘 Polling vs Webhooks
        > 
        > If you are using the `GET` document status endpoint for [**polling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)), we also support and recommend using **webhooks** for event-driven needs: <https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/listen-document-status-changes#/>

        ### Available Document Statuses

        The following is a complete list of all possible document statuses returned:

        | Document Status             | Status Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
        | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `document.uploaded`         | The document has just been created or uploaded. It is in processing and will be in `document.draft` state soon.                                                                                                           |
        | `document.error`            | The document creation has failed. This status is terminal, you should stop polling after getting it.

        > 🚧 Using the Sandbox Key
        > 
        > When you use a [sandbox API key](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/sandbox-key) during the free trial period, the sender and recipient email addresses must be from the same organisation (email domain).

        ## Document State

        - You can only send a document in the `document.draft` status.
        - After creating a new document, it usually retains a `document.uploaded` status for 3-5 seconds while the document syncs across PandaDoc servers. When the document is available for further API calls, it moves to the `document.draft` state. Use [Document Status](/reference/document-status) or [Webhooks](/reference/on-document-status-change) to check document status.
        - Moving a document to the `document.sent` status finalizes the document structure, before recipients can complete it.
        - If a template used for the document creation has an approval workflow turned on, the sent document moves to the `document.waiting_approval` status. Once the document is approved, you need to make the call again to move the document to `document.sent` status.

        ## Send and Silence Notifications

        - By default, PandaDoc sends a notification email to the recipient, as well as notifications the sender has configured. You may disable all notifications for recipients by passing `silent: true`. This is useful when you are using alternative delivery methods such as linking to the document or embedding the document.
        - The `silent: true` parameter disables sent, viewed, comment and completed document email notifications. "Document Approval" notification won't be affected by this parameter.
        - If you pass `silent: false`, the document is going to be delivered by email and/or SMS.

        ## Select Approver from Group

        If you have previously set up an approval workflow with selectable groups on the UI, you can select a particular approver from this group. Learn more about [selectable groups](https://support.pandadoc.com/en/articles/9714799-approval-workflow#h_01H4GNY5GSGG38BPYY46XV7GB4).  
        To set an approver, we recommend to follow these steps:

        1. Run the [Document Details](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/document-details) request.
        2. Copy the `steps` part from the `approval_execution` section of the response into the `selected_approvers` field of the Send Document payload.
        3. Modify your payload according to business needs: set `is_selected` to true for one approver.

        > 📘 **Note**: You can change the selected approver only if you revert your document back to the `document.draft` status.

        Create Document Editing Session
      description: |
        Creates a new editing session for the Embedded Editor. The response includes an E-Token, which is required to open the document.

        > 🚧 **Important:** The Embedded Editor can only open documents that have a `draft` status.

        #### Limitations

        - **Single Active Session per User-Document Pair** 
          Only one editing session can be active at a time for a specific user and document. Creating a new session for the same user-document pair will automatically invalidate the previous one.

        - **Weekly Session Cap** 
          A maximum of **250** editing sessions can be created for a single document per week. Any attempt to exceed this limit will result in a `403 Forbidden` error.

        Add a CC recipient to a document.

        > 🚧 Before you start
        > 
        > To add a CC recipient, please ensure that:
        > 
        > - You have the 'Can Manage Recipients' permission.
        > - This recipient is already created in your contacts. If not, add them using the [Create Contact](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/create-contact) endpoint.

        To add a new CC recipient to a document, two parameters must be included in the request body:

        - `kind`: Set this parameter to `contact` to specify an individual contact.
        - `id`:  Input the ID of the desired contact.

        To retrieve the contact's ID, use the [List Contacts](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/list-contacts) endpoint to access a list of all contacts, and then locate the desired contact by searching using the name or email address within the returned list.

        ### Document status

        You can add CC recipients in any document status except for the 'Expired' (`document.voided`) and 'Declined' (`document.declined`).

        > 📘 Email notification to access the document
        > 
        > **Note**: When a document is in one of the following statuses: 'Sent' (`document.sent`), 'Viewed' (`document.viewed`), 'Completed' (`document.completed`), 'Waiting for Payment' (`document.waiting_pay`), or 'Paid' (`document.paid`), any added CC recipient will receive an instant notification at their email address, allowing them access to the document.

        Remove a recipient from a document.

        > Please ensure that you have the 'Can Manage Recipients' permission.

        To remove a recipient from a document, you must specify their ID in the path parameter (note that this is different from their contact's ID). The recipient's ID can be retrieved via the [Document Details](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/document-details) endpoint.

        ### Document status

        - Removing a signer is only possible when the document is in the 'Draft' (`document.draft`) status and this action will unassign all fields associated with that signer.
        - Removing a CC recipient is allowed in any document status except for the 'Expired' (`document.voided`) and 'Declined' (`document.declined`). If a CC recipient is removed, their access will be revoked.

        Use this endpoint to easily fix typos in a recipient's name or email, or to change any other recipient information in a sent document. 

        > 📘 Please note that changes made to a recipient within a document will also update their `Contact` information. However, these changes will not update information about this recipient in other documents where they have already been added.

        ### Document status

        - You can edit a signer in the following document statuses:
          - 'Draft' (`document.draft`),
          - 'Waiting Approval' (`document.waiting_approval`),
          - 'Approved' (`document.approved`),
          - 'Rejected' (`document.rejected`),
          - 'Sent' (`document.sent`),
          - 'Viewed' (`document.viewed`), but only until they have signed the document.
        - You can edit a CC recipient in any document status **except**:
          - 'Expired' (`document.voided`),
          - 'Declined' (`document.declined`).

        > 📘 Updating a recipient's email after sending a document
        > 
        > **Note**: If you update a recipient's email address after sending a document, they will receive an instant notification at the new email address, allowing them access to the document. Access via the previous email will be revoked.

        ### Restrictions for updating a recipient's email

        - You cannot change emails of PandaDoc users.
        - You cannot use the email addresses of existing contacts. If you need to use an email from an existing contact, use the [Change Signer](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/change-signer) endpoint to replace a signer with this contact.

        Reassign fields to another signer.

        > 🚧 Before you start
        > 
        > To change a signer in a document, please ensure that:
        > 
        > - You have the 'Can Manage Recipients' permission.
        > - New signer is already created in your contacts. If not, add them using the [Create Contact](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/create-contact) endpoint.

        You can reassign fields to another signer before the original signer has signed the document. You can choose any person except those recipients who have already signed the document.

        The endpoint path includes the `recipient_id` of the original signer and the request body must include the following two parameters:

        - `kind`: Set this parameter to `contact` to specify an individual contact.
        - `id`: Input the ID of the contact you want to use as a replacement for the original signer.

        To retrieve the contact's ID, use the [List Contacts](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/list-contacts) endpoint to access a list of all contacts, and then locate the desired contact by searching using the name or email address within the returned list.

        Once you execute the call to change the signer, the original signer will be entirely removed from the document. If you wish to retain the original signer as a CC recipient, you can re-add them using the [Add CC Recipient](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/add-new-recipient-cc) endpoint.

        > 🚧 Pre-filled fields
        > 
        > If you change the signer in a document that has already been sent, the signer's pre-filled fields will be completely reset. In the 'Draft' (`document.draft`) status, pre-filled fields will remain.

To enable this feature, pass the optional `parse_form_fields` value as `true` when making a create document section API call. We support Text fields, Dropdowns, and Signature fields.\n\n  If you would like to pass additional parameters to configure PDF form fields, use the PDF field name as an optId. You can use a PDF editor such as Adobe Acrobat, Foxit to get and edit field names in your PDF.\n\n  [**Download a Sample PDF with Form Fields**](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2127247/public-templates/SamplePandaDocPdf_FormFields.pdf)\n\n  ### PDF/DocX/RTF Field Tags\n\n  This parsing format allows a word processor such as [Microsoft Word](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Save-as-PDF-d85416c5-7d77-4fd6-a216-6f4bf7c7c110?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) or [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2423534?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) to prepare a document and save it in PDF, DocX or RTF format.\n\n  Within the text, PandaDoc parses field tags. A field tag starts and ends with brackets. The field tag includes basic information on how to create a form field in the PandaDoc document. The request JSON object `optId` can also extend this information for even greater control.\n\n  Here is an example of how the field tag in a PDF/DocX/RTF  is converted to a text field in the PandaDoc document:\n\n  ![](https://files.readme.io/38afedf-ex3.png \"ex3.png\")\n\n  [**Download a Sample PDF with Field Tags**](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2127247/public-templates/SamplePandaDocPdf_FieldTags.pdf)\n\n  #### PDF Field Tag Key\n\n  ![](https://files.readme.io/a81fbf1-field-tag-structure.png \"field-tag-structure.png\")\n\n  | Number | Key         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example                           |\n  | :----- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |\n  | 1      | `fieldType` | Field type from the table documented below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `signature`, or `s` for shorthand |\n  | 2      | `*`         | Optional `*` denotes the field is not required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `*`                               |\n  | 3      | `role`      | Role name.

      summary: Create Document Section from File Upload
      operationId: uploadSectionWithUpload
      description: "With this endpoint, you can add a new section to an existing PandaDoc document (create a bundle). The section is created from a file you upload. The file can be a PDF, DocX, or RTF.\n\n> 📘 We've prepared two samples that you can use to test the request.\n> Download them here:\n>\n> - [Download a Sample PDF with Form Fields](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2127247/public-templates/SamplePandaDocPdf_FormFields.pdf) \n> - [Download a Sample PDF with Field Tags](https://5132871.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/5132871/SamplePandaDocPdf_FieldTags_updated.pdf)\n\n\n> 🚧 Usage specifics\n> \n> 1. This method uses a `multipart/form-data` request type instead of the `application/json` typically found in the PandaDoc API. This is to accommodate the upload of the included document.\n> 2. You can send a URL instead of a file in the document creation request.  \n>    In this case, you need to use the `application/json` content type and add the URL parameter in the body request. As an example, see [Create from public PDF](https://developers.pandadoc.com/docs/create-and-send-a-document-from-a-publicly-available-pdf) guide for more details.\n> 3. A file you upload is not stored in your PandaDoc account, so you have to upload it with every request.\n\n> ❗️ Limitations\n> \n> 1. This method does not support multiple documents.\n> 2. The maximum supported file size is 50 MB. API returns \"413 Request entity too large\" in case of bigger files.\n> 3. PandaDoc does not support creating document from a PDF with encrypted files (to check whether a file is encrypted or not, try Get info -> Secure: Password Encrypted).\n\n> ⏱️ Document Section creation is a non-blocking (asynchronous) operation\n> \n> The document creation process may take some time.\n> \n> With a successful request, you receive a response with the created upload ID and status `document_sections_upload.uploaded`. After processing completes on our servers, usually a few seconds, the document moves to the `document_sections_upload.PROCESSED` status.\n\n## PDF Form Fields\n\nPandaDoc recognizes PDF form fields. To enable this feature, pass the optional `parse_form_fields` value as `true` when making a create document section API call. We support Text fields, Dropdowns, and Signature fields.\n\nIf you would like to pass additional parameters to configure PDF form fields, use the PDF field name as an optId. You can use a PDF editor such as Adobe Acrobat, Foxit to get and edit field names in your PDF.\n\n[**Download a Sample PDF with Form Fields**](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2127247/public-templates/SamplePandaDocPdf_FormFields.pdf)\n\n## PDF/DocX/RTF Field Tags\n\nThis parsing format allows a word processor such as [Microsoft Word](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Save-as-PDF-d85416c5-7d77-4fd6-a216-6f4bf7c7c110?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) or [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2423534?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) to prepare a document and save it in PDF, DocX or RTF format.\n\nWithin the text, PandaDoc parses field tags. A field tag starts and ends with brackets. The field tag includes basic information on how to create a form field in the PandaDoc document. The request JSON object `optId` can also extend this information for even greater control.\n\nHere is an example of how the field tag in a PDF/DocX/RTF  is converted to a text field in the PandaDoc document:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/38afedf-ex3.png \"ex3.png\")\n\n[**Download a Sample PDF with Field Tags**](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2127247/public-templates/SamplePandaDocPdf_FieldTags.pdf)\n\n<details>\n\n  ### PDF Field Tag Key\n\n  ![](https://files.readme.io/a81fbf1-field-tag-structure.png \"field-tag-structure.png\")\n\n  | Number | Key         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example                           |\n  | :----- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |\n  | 1      | `fieldType` | Field type from the table documented below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `signature`, or `s` for shorthand |\n  | 2      | `*`         | Optional `*` denotes the field is not required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `*`                               |\n  | 3      | `role`      | Role name.

        Receive the upload status of the document and sections by their `upload_id`.

        Requesting document section upload status is useful to ensure a document section upload is in the expected state before calling additional API methods.

        In response, you receive an array with `sections_uuid`. You can receive information about each section using the [Document Section Info](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/document-section-info) endpoint.

        ```json
            "section_uuids": [
                "H8T8CJofGY6JwTsWsPuDEF",
                "8MwLaU4SaZywqLiDk26mDF"

        Creates a new editing session for the Embedded Editor. The response includes an E-Token, which is required to open the template.

        #### Limitations

        - **Single Active Session per User-Template Pair** 
          Only one editing session can be active at a time for a specific user and template. Creating a new session for the same user-template pair will automatically invalidate the previous one.

        - **Weekly Session Cap** 
          A maximum of **250** editing sessions can be created for a single template per week. Any attempt to exceed this limit will result in a `403 Forbidden` error.

        Retrieve all members details of the workspace implied by the OAuth token or API key.\
        For each member, the `workspace` parameter shows their active workspace, that is the workspace they are currently working in.\

      summary: Create Notarization Request
      operationId: createNotarizationRequest
      description: |
        Create a notarization request to connect with a notary and complete online notarizations for your signers within minutes.

        > 🚧 **Important:** This endpoint supports only documents in draft status.

        ## Prerequisites

        > 🚧 Before you start
        > 
        > Ensure the following before creating a notarization request:
        > 
        > - Install the Notary On-Demand or Notary add-on
        > - Create a document for notarization and get its `document_id`. To create a document, use the [Create Document from Template](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/create-document-from-pandadoc-template) or [Create Document from File Upload](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/create-document-from-pdf) endpoint.

        ## Request Details

        For the notarization request, include in the request body:

        - `document_id`
        - At least one `invitees`, specifying their `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name`
        - Optionally, include a `message` for your signers
        - Optionally, using `disable_invitees_notifications` you can disable all notifications for invitees including email with invitation for notarization. This is useful when you are using alternative delivery methods.
        - If in-house notary must be assigned to this request, include the `notary` object with the notary's `id`, `scheduled_at` timestamp, and an optional `message` for the notary

        After the API call is executed, your signers will receive an email invitation for notarization. Alternatively, you can directly share the `notarization_link` with your signers, which is available in the 201 response body.

        Upon successful notarization, you will receive an email with a link to the notarized document.

        ## Usage Tips

        > 📘 Best Practices
        > 
        > - Ensure that signers are added as both invitees in the request body and recipients in the document to avoid inconveniences during notary sessions
        > - Signers will receive an email with a notary link upon a successful API call; this link is also in the 201 response
        > - In case if notary is not specified in the request, signers will use the link to connect with commissioned online notaries, available Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 9 PM Central Time, typically responding within 2 minutes
        > - If notary is specified, signers will use the link to connect with your in-house notary at the scheduled time

        ## Limits

        A maximum of 100 API calls per minute is permitted. Exceeding this limit triggers a 429 Too Many Requests error.

        ## Troubleshooting

        **Solutions for 4xx Response Codes:**

        - **403 Forbidden (Inactive Add-on)**: Ensure the Notary On-Demand or Notary add-on is installed
        - **403 Forbidden (Transactions Limit)**: Purchase additional transactions either through the Notary UI or by contacting the Sales team
        - **429 Too Many Requests**: If you hit the limit, hold your API calls, then send them after waiting for the retry time

        ## Available Notarization Request Statuses

        The following is a complete list of all possible notarization request statuses returned:

        | Notarization Request Status | Status Description                                                                                                 |

        | SENT                        | Notarization request has been created. Invitees are notified and can start the process of finding a notary.        |
        | WAITING_FOR_NOTARY          | One of the invitees initialised the process of finding a notary.                                                   |
        | ACCEPTED                    | Notarization request has been accepted by the notary. At this time nobody has joined the notarization session yet. |
        | LIVE                        | Notarization session has started.                                                                                  |
        | COMPLETED                   | Notarization session is finished. Documents have been successfully signed and ready for downloading.               |
        | INCOMPLETE                  | Notarization session has started but was not completed successfully.                                               |

        ## Signed documents

        Signed documents are the documents that were successfully signed during the notarization session. The signed document's info is available only if the notarization request has `COMPLETED` status, otherwise the returned list will be empty.  

        In case you uploaded several documents for notarization then the `signed_documents` list will contain links for downloading for each document separately (with `SINGLE` document type) and link for the combined document (with `COMBINED` document type accordingly).

        ## Recording

        Recording is the video of the notarization session. The recording info is available only if the notarization request has `COMPLETED` status and recording is available, otherwise the returned object will be empty.

        > 📘 Links expire in 1 hour
        > 
        > **Note**: The signed document and recording links expire in 1 hour. After this time it will be not possible to download files using the returned urls. In this case you need to call endpoint again since each request generates a new link.

        ## Limits

        A maximum of 100 API calls per minute is permitted. Exceeding this limit triggers a 429 Too Many Requests error.

          type: object
          description: |
            Set specific values to the fields. This object maps merge field names to their corresponding values.

            Each key represents a merge field name, and each value is an object containing the data to populate that field with. The structure allows you to pre-populate various field types including text inputs, checkboxes, dropdowns, and date fields.

            **Key Points:**
            - Keys must match the exact merge field names from your template or file.
            - Values must be wrapped in an object with a `value` property.
            - Supported value types: string, number, boolean.
            - Date fields should use RFC 3339 format (e.g., '2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z').
            - Signature fields cannot be pre-filled.

            **Example Usage:**
            - Text field: `"CustomerName": {"value": "John Doe"}`
            - Checkbox: `"AgreeToTerms": {"value": true}`
            - Date field: `"DeliveryDate": {"value": "2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}`
          example:
            Like:
              value: true
            Delivery:
              value: Same Day Delivery
            Date:
              value: '2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z'

                  The value to pre-fill the field with. The type of the value depends on the field type in the template.
                  For example, for a checkbox field, you can pass a boolean value, and for a date field, you can pass a date string in RFC 3339 format (e.g., 2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z).

        fields:
          type: object
          description: |
            Set specific values to the fields. This object maps merge field names to their corresponding values.

            Each key represents a merge field name, and each value is an object containing the data to populate that field with. The structure allows you to pre-populate various field types including text inputs, checkboxes, dropdowns, and date fields.

            **Key Points:**
            - Keys must match the exact merge field names from your template or file.
            - Values must be wrapped in an object with a `value` property.
            - Supported value types: string, number, boolean.
            - Date fields should use RFC 3339 format (e.g., '2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z').
            - Signature fields cannot be pre-filled.

            **Example Usage:**
            - Text field: `"CustomerName": {"value": "John Doe"}`
            - Checkbox: `"AgreeToTerms": {"value": true}`
            - Date field: `"DeliveryDate": {"value": "2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}`
          example:
            Like:
              value: true
            Delivery:
              value: Same Day Delivery
            Date:

                  The value to pre-fill the field with. The type of the value depends on the field type in the template.
                  For example, for a checkbox field, you can pass a boolean value, and for a date field, you can pass a date string in RFC 3339 format (e.g., 2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z).

        Set specific values to the fields. This object maps merge field names to their corresponding values.

        Each key represents a merge field name, and each value is an object containing the data to populate that field with. The structure allows you to pre-populate various field types including text inputs, checkboxes, dropdowns, and date fields.

        **Key Points:**
        - Keys must match the exact merge field names from your template or file.
        - Values must be wrapped in an object with a `value` property.
        - Supported value types: string, number, boolean.
        - Date fields should use RFC 3339 format (e.g., '2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z').
        - Signature fields cannot be pre-filled.

        **Example Usage:**
        - Text field: `"CustomerName": {"value": "John Doe"}`
        - Checkbox: `"AgreeToTerms": {"value": true}`
        - Date field: `"DeliveryDate": {"value": "2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}`
      example:
        Like:
          value: true
        Delivery:
          value: Same Day Delivery
        Date:
          value: '2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z'

              The value to pre-fill the field with. The type of the value depends on the field type in the template.
              For example, for a checkbox field, you can pass a boolean value, and for a date field, you can pass a date string in RFC 3339 format (e.g., 2019-12-31T00:00:00.000Z).

        Send the authenticating user to the PandaDoc OAuth2 request URL. We recommend a button or a link titled
        "Connect to PandaDoc" if you are connecting users from a custom application. Users will see the "Authorize Application" screen.
        When the user clicks "Authorize", PandaDoc redirects the user back to your site with an authorization code inside the URL.

        https://app.pandadoc.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope=read+write&response_type=code

        `client_id` and `redirect_uri` values should match your application settings.
